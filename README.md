# Portfolio and repo description
A portfolio is a collection of representative work.   In this class, your portfolio should be a set of R notebooks  (R markdown documents and the associated html document resulting from preview.)

A notebook should be a short analysis of a problem, illustrating a particular skill that you have learned in this class.

FOR THIS CLASS - YOUR PORTFOLIO SHOULD BE IN A DIRECTORY ON YOUR GITHUB PAGE.   You should simply submit a link to that repository folder.  That repository should contain data, if needed, to allow your Rmd files to run.

Some example skills that I would like you to demonstrate or that you could demonstrate:

- Visualizing data using ggplot2 (scatterplot, histogram, barchart, lineplot).
- Manipulate data (demonstrate dplyr verbs   filter, summarise, join, select, rename, slice).
- Data loading and tidying and cleaning (to include    pivot-wider   and pivot-longer)
- Data science process (major steps)  [Harder]

## Course description
This course introduces the basics of data manipulation and pre-processing to analyze data for statistical decisionmaking, building the skills required to organize, visualize, and communicate using data. The course seeks to help students address this question: given data from the world of science, engineering, medicine, etc., collected from multitude of sensors and sources, how do you begin to make sense of that data – and how do you use it? The primary tool for coding will be R/RStudio, but supporting Python syntax and libraries may also be introduced. The course emphasizes not only the low-level coding skills, but also the higher-level critical and quantitative reasoning skills required to analyze real-world datasets. Topics introduce key concepts such as descriptive statistics and sampling distribution (as a means to view large and very large data sets) and the basic analysis tools of Linear Regression and Data Mining. Additional topics may include social network data, unstructured data, and natural language text processing.needed to conduct to apply data mining techniques to problems from their own domain of expertise.
