# Portfolio and repo description

A portfolio is a collection of representative work.   In this class, your portfolio should be a set of R notebooks  (R markdown documents and the associated html document resulting from preview.)

A notebook should be a short analysis of a problem, illustrating a particular skill that you have learned in this class.

FOR THIS CLASS - YOUR PORTFOLIO SHOULD BE IN A DIRECTORY ON YOUR GITHUB PAGE.   You should simply submit a link to that repository folder.  That repository should contain data, if needed, to allow your Rmd files to run.

Some example skills that I would like you to demonstrate or that you could demonstrate:

- Visualizing data using ggplot2 (scatterplot, histogram, barchart, lineplot).
- Manipulate data (demonstrate dplyr verbs   filter, summarise, join, select, rename, slice).
- Data loading and tidying and cleaning (to include    pivot-wider   and pivot-longer)
- Data science process (major steps)  [Harder]
